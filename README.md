# MysticLauncher
Mystic Launcher is a minimalistic launcher for WoW Private Servers written in C#.

Mystic Launcher allows you to set the current directories for Vanilla, The Burning Crusade, and Wrath of the Lich King.

Mystic Launcher also allows you to add as many servers as you would like and will automatically update the realmlist.wtf file at launch depending on which server you choose to play.
